# Diffusion-model-implementation-applied-machine-learning-course-project

This is an implementation of diffusion model for image generation. It is done as group project for the Applied Machine Learning course at [CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). Our group comprised of [Aryansh Saxena](https://github.com/Ars-Gilfoyle-99), [Krishanu Bandyopadhyay](https://github.com/krish-baner) and [Bijayan Ray](https://github.com/BijayanRay). 

This model is trained on flower dataset from kaggle to generate flower images. One can use their own dataset to train the model for specific image generation.
