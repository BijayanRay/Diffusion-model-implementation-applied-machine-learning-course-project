# Diffusion-model-implementation-applied-machine-learning-course-project

This is an implementation of diffusion model for image generation. It is done as group project for the Applied Machine Learning course at [CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). Our group comprised of [Aryansh Saxena](https://github.com/Ars-Gilfoyle-99), [Krishanu Bandyopadhyay](https://github.com/krish-baner) and [Bijayan Ray](https://github.com/BijayanRay). 

This model is trained on flower dataset from kaggle to generate flower images. One can use their own dataset to train the model for specific image generation. In each of the version folders there is a ``project-notebook.ipynb`` and ``project-notebook-without-html-animation.ipynb`` jupyter notebook file which are basically the same except the output of the ``HTML(animated.to_jshtml())`` is removed in ``project-notebook-without-html-animation.ipynb`` jupyter notebook file since that cell was creating issue in loading on complete ipynb notebook on github preview. However one can clone the repository and open the notebooks locally to get the html animations from ``project-notebook.ipynb`` jupyter notebook file.
