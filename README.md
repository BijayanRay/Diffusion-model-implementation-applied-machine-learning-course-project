# Diffusion-model-implementation-applied-machine-learning-course-project

This is an implementation of diffusion model for image generation. It is done as group project for the Applied machine learning course at [CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). Our group comprised of Aryansh Saxena, Krishanu Bandyopadhyay, Bijayan Ray. 

This model is trained on flower dataset from kaggle to generate flower images. One can use their own dataset to train the model for specific image generation.
